# GitHub Projects TUI
A simple command-line interface for interacting with GitHub Projects

## Features
- Full support for editing item fields (apart from iterations or issue/pr titles)
- Adding items (no deletion just yet)
- Can easily switch between projects
- Vim keybindings

If there is anything else you need, open an issue and I'll try to add it ASAP.

## Install
clone this repo and build it,

or `cargo install gh-project-cli` (not working yet)
